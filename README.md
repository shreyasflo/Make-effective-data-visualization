For this project, you will create a data visualization from a data set that tells a story or highlights trends or patterns in the data. You will need to use either dimple.js or d3.js to create the visualization. Your work should be a reflection of the theory and practice of data visualization, such as visual encodings, design principles, and effective communication.

Contents:
the original index.html file for the first version of your graphic (e.g. index1.html)
the final index.html file for the final version of your graphic (e.g. index.html, index_final.html)
the README.md file with the sections Summary, Design, Feedback, and Resources
the final data set file used for the graphic (usually .csv, .tsv, or .json)
OPTIONAL: additional versions of your index.html as you iterated on your visualization based on feedback (e.g. index1.html, index2.html, index3.html, ... , index_final.html)
